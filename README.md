# Client-side SUDOKU solver

The goal of this project is to show the knowledge
of **recursion / backtracking**, and its use in solving sudoku.

The computation is based purely on [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) and is being calculated in browser using Javascript.

**CSS** and **HTML** were used to style the sudoku field.
